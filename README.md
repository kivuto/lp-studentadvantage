lp-studentadvantage
===================

Landing Page for Student Advantage done by Kivuto Solutions Inc.

##A/B Tests

As of 28/05/2014 there is currently A/B tests undergoing on the LP. This is facilitated through an `index-b.php` which includes certain blocks that also have a `-b.php` suffix. These `b` pages have slightly altered content and/or structure.

* A/B Testing active; changes must be made to both pages when editing, ie;
  * A `./microsoft-student-advantage-deployment/index.php`
  * B `./microsoft-student-advantage-deployment/index-b.php`



##Features

This landing page comes with dynamic scroll event tracking. It will track all of the blocks as you scroll down, no matter the order the blocks are in. It automatically detects which order the blocks are in and handles users viewing each block. All you need to do is make sure the block names are in order, and it will work.
